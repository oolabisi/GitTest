/* Sort in git, a list of 10 numbers
in ascending order
I am starting a Psedo-code*/

// Given numbers are; (1,4,7,5,6,8,10,9,3,2)
//to rearrange this number in ascending order,
//I will check and pick out the least number first
// i.e. '1' is the least number from the list above.
// then I will add "++" to the first least number
// i.e. ++1 = 2;
// ++2 = 3;
// In similar way I will continue in the same method
// till I get the last ascending number which is 10, for this question.
